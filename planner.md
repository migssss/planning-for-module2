# website content: fundamentals.
  1. ![sitemap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109973918/184174538-966758bc-6398-49de-a517-d763eea024e2.png)
  
  2. Layout Considerations
  
   * Very few icons to navigate through my website (for easy access)
   
   * Website's title will be the header, but not too giant
   
   * Have a strip of the color black on my left hand side for small photo gallery as they click through each photo in the collection
   
   * Main page will be an easy scroll down as Collection thumbnails fade in and fade out
   
  3. Typography
  
   * Bolded words (with the help of a white clean background
   
   * More than fairly space in between things
   
   * A regular font at a slightly bigger than average font size will do. 
  
  4. Colors
  
   * White or Beige overall color
   
   * A small strip of black on the left side of the website (ONLY when in Collections)
    
  5. Functionality
  
   * Feedback/Leave a message tab for users to interact with me by telling me what they think about my website
   
   * When clicking on certain photos, a more bigger, clear image will pop up over the page with a small caption on the right side.

  6. Target Audience
  
   * Artists
   
   * People who admire other art
   
   * People looking for other's creativity
   
   * Portfolio Reputation
